# ThirstWasTakenHelper
 Simply create a config for items for Thirst was taken


All you need to do is run the Thirstscript.py and then copy the items from the config you created to inside the items_settings file.

Thanks to Pyrael (NOT PARVEL, SORRY TIRED COMMIT) For his and his friend's additions and modifications that allow for the compat library, plus the FAQ! 

FAQ

Q: What does this tool do?
A: It helps you make compats for the "Thirst was Taken" mod and other food/drinks items added by other mods either by compiling from a supplied library or create 1 for the mod yourself.

Q: What does the 'Common Items from Mods' button do?
A: I have a library of compats for several mods already (In the Compat Library folder). Clicking on Common Items from Mods will have a dropdown menu with all the mods made compat). You can add more compats yourself by downloading a toml file from the discord and add it to the Compat Library folder or creating a new toml file using this tool.If you want to contribute to the library, feel free to join my Discord and share your compats with the name of the mods made compatible as the toml name.

Q: I want to make a compat for a mod that is not supplied/posted in the discord. What should I do?
A: You can use this mod "Tell Me" (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tellme), it will help you dump all the available food items, from there you can see which mod added food/drink.
For version 1.20+, you can use this pull-request of the mod (https://github.com/IMarvinTPA/tellme/tree/forge_1.20.x). Remember to git clone MarvinTPA's pull request, not Maruohon's git, or else it won't work.

Have fun.
